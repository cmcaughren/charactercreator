The goal for this sideproject to practise csci 161 material. Classes, inheritence, template classes, linked lists, sorting and searching, compiling and make files, use of git and github to track progress.

This side project will be designed to create "characters" which have a collection of characteristics. Species, homeland, career. These categories will have associated stats connected to them. The goal of this project is to create a program which will randomly design a character and assemble its character attributes.

Further ideas for this project include:
-creating linked list "teams" of characters
-sorting those teams by characteristics (ie, sort by strength)
-ability to save these characters or teams


Possibly extensions:
-name randomizer
-pets
-armour
-team battles (turn based)
-story lines?
